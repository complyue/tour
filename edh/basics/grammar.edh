{## Overview
 # - Why and What is here with Đ

Đ seeks to ease development of embedded DSLs (Domain Specific Langauges) speaking / realizing business needs, i.e. a Business Integration language. How computers work and to be optimized in solving programming problems, are addressed by a large research discipline in its own right, i.e. Computer Science. But CS is too different and often too far from practical needs of realworld business, dedicated languages are of much interest, and Đ attempts to be a comprehensive solution.

**Đ (Edh)** stands for **Event Distributing & Hosting**, an _event_ is a consistent (but not necessarily atomic) piece of data, encapsulating the information of something just happend in one place, and sent to another place for its consequences to be realized there. _Event_ is conceptually coherent to **Algebraic Data Type** in _type theory_ as well as a functional programming language, but it's not practical to be a mechanical utility in a procedural langauge like Đ. So _event_ stays conceptual in Đ the language.

The _event_ abstraction should decouple much of the complexity, and degrade much part of the problem, to be solvable by _Citizen Developers_, especially with the aid of modern software engineering toolings.

You will be using Đ to describe reactions to incoming events from other parts of the system, in forms of local entity attribute updates, and more complex logics with control flows. As well, you can post commands for event delivery, to other parts of the system. Modularized components can be developed for reuse, by your team or by 3rd parties. Realworld systems are inherently effectful, any event upon it is distributed / hosted, usually implies effects it should cause, you will also use Đ to describe what effects are expected to be there, and how those effects should be realized. Note effects are inherently context sensitive, as a fairly sophisticated effect is usually implemented by means of other effects, those maybe simpler but nevertheless sensitive to their own context.

**Monad** is state of the art way for effect tracking, while **Algebraic Effects & Handlers** being actively researched in academic for similiar purpose today, but they both work with functional programming langauges. Then inspired by **Algebraic Effects & Handlers**, Đ implements **Dynamic Scoped Effects** for effect tracking in the imperative / procedural paradigm. It is **Dynamic Scoping** per se. Historically, **Dynamic Scoping** designs are proved failures, but with Đ's dedicated syntax / namespacing to have dynamic artifacts isolated from lexical artifacts, the confusing semantics / behaviors can be avoided, and then finally done right.

  {## The Official Đ Code Formatter
   # - Any style you like, so long as it is formatted such

Đ encourages (turns-on-by-default) format-on-save, by the official no-config, uncompromised formatter:

  https://github.com/e-wrks/edh-vscode-formatter
  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ComplYue.edh-vscode-formatter

The motivation of such a formatter is quite inspired by Black:

  https://black.readthedocs.io

That's to save you time and mental energy for more important matters.

FYI, the original idea comes from Henry Ford's famous quotes about the Model T:

> Any customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants,
> so long as it is black.

Also opinionated formatters with similar goals:
  https://prettier.io  - Prettier for JavaScript (and HTML, CSS etc.)
  https://github.com/tweag/ormolu  - Ormolu for Haskell

The programmer is responsible for the brackets (scoping), while the formatter is in charge of proper indentation, it infers indentation level of each line from the nesting of brackets.

Well, this conclusion holds right in its time, when auto code formatters are still some luxury to have. But today, besides the compiler(s), we are affording way more expensive analyzing tools like linters, test runners, coverage, profilers, and usually comprehensive langauge servers, amongst what code formatters become rather commonplace.

Scopes (either lexical or conceptual) have to be decided and expressed by the programmer (or document writer), but even excluding extreme cases, a code block can consist of up to hundreds of lines, it's ridiculous to manually maintain proper indentation for every line, when the formatter can do it for you straight forward.

Whitespace sensitivity has become outdated today, brackets (curly, square or round) come handy-dandy to express various scopes in your mind, just leave indentation for the formatters to care about.

      type( {} )

      # The answer is: The semicolon inside `{;}` disambiguates it being a block (though empty) instead of an empty dict expressed as `{}`

      # FYI, in Đ, block is a type of expression (instead of statement as in C family languages). A block encloses arbitrary number of statements, and evaluates to the value of the last statement when executed (with the exceptin of branches' early break, though, about that later)

      }

    }

  }


  {## Recommended Line Length
   # - It is under your control, well some advice here

For the record, Đ langauge support extension for VSCode sets the following config options per the language:

* Show rulers at column positions: 80, 100, 120
* Soft-wrap lines at 100, while adapting to narrower window width

You are recommended to hard-wrap source lines around column 80, and that's not for good old line printers set for Fortran punch cards, but to enable a human reader have 2~3 editor columns layed out on wide screens, to cross check code segments from multiple sites, without necessarity of tab switching, which is good for productivity.

For long paragraphs in comments, of mere documentation purpose, it's considered more idiomatic to keep them as long lines per each paragraph, so you don't need to manually maintain hard-wrap points when update documentation, just leave it soft-wrapped at 100 columns by default.

Nevertheless you can change per user settings of your IDE, for a different soft wrap strategy.

{## Entities, Attributes and Identifiers
 # - Each entity consists of a dynamic set of attribute values identified by distinct identifiers

Entity is the logical unit of information that organized in an Đ world. Entities only exist conceptually, some entities are used to each back a scope (module scope or procedure scope), other entities are used to each back an object (excepting host objects). While some objects (e.g. module objects, namespace objects, class objects) each encapsulate a scope of its own, such an object and the scope it encapsolutes are both backed by a same entity.

Đ is rather dynamic in nature - at runtime, not only each individual attribute value can change arbitrarily, new attributes can be added to an entity, as well as existing attributes can be deleted from it. That is to say, the structure as well as the attribute values of each entity can vary on its own at runtime.

 #} {;
  {## Entities, Attributes and Identifiers #}
  export edh'ent'attr'naming = bookmark()


  {## Mutable Entities
   # - Dynamic means mutability

All program states of an Đ program pertain to certain entities at the run. Be it a scope, or an object, its backing entity can always be mutated, at any time, as within an Đ world. The modifications usually come from the software component managing program states, but it's fairly common for some monitoring UIs, or interactive REPLs over stdio or network (SSH, WebSocket, etc.) to observe/change the program states for diagnostics / troubleshooting purposes.

   #} {;
    {## Mutable Entities #}
    export edh'entities = bookmark()
  }


  {## Attribute Identifiers
   # - About naming attributes

Each attribute of an entity has to be uniquely identified within scope of this entity. In Đ, the usual alphanumeric "variable" identifiers (like in other programming languages) can be used.

In addition, symbolic identifiers are also supported and recommended for cross-component scenarios.

And technically, any string (even the empty string) can serve as an attribute identifier in Đ, with at-notation.

Note that the "variable" concept in conventional programming languages is misleading/conflicting when you could possibly have mathematical concepts in the domain model of your business, to avoid such conceptional conflicts, Đ the language does not use the concept "variable", leaving it for the domain model.

FYI, traditonal "variable" more properly should be called "assignable" as suggested in:
  https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2013/07/22/there-is-such-a-thing-as-a-declarative-language
Attributes of entities in Đ are inherently meant to be assigned (as well as to be observed), so the concept of "assignable" is neither needed.

Note the single-quote character is allowed to mean the prime symbol as in mathematics, following Haskell convention.

  {## Namespacing and Dot-Notation
   # - Every entity is a namespace (in general sense)

As every attribute is uniquely identified by a name within an entity, it naturally becomes a namespace, where the identifiers form the set of names. Though the set is highly dynamic, in the sense that an attribute value after a new name can be added at any time, as well as existing names deleted thereof.

Dot-notation is the norm with imperative programming languages, the reason probably lies in the better ergonomics when mutable data structures are manipulated, as the syntactic sugar for field read/write, that exactly the same syntax is used for the target.

FYI in functional programming languages (such as Haskell), the dot (.) is already used as the operator for function composition, there are alternative means of namespacing (such as "lenses") are used instead of dot-notation.

{## Expressions and Statements
 # - A piece of Đ code is just a sequence of statements

Expression is a special (yet very important) type of statement, an expression yields a meaningful result when evaluated. Note that an expression may or may not have side-effects when evaluated.

Expressions can be combined together (e.g. by an infix, binary operator, among other forms), to form a new expression, so a complex expression can consist of many sub-expressions organized in a deeply nested hierarchy.

For a statement of some type other than _expression_, when evaluated, it doesn't yield a meaningful result, instead it produces desriable side-effects.

Đ is _strict_ in evaluation of statements, an Đ interpreter program evaluates a statement immediately upon one is encountered. The contrary is _lazy_ evaluation, in which sense the actually evaluation can be postponed until absolutely necessary.

    let (a, b, c,) = (3, 2, 7,)

    # %% # Arithmetic expressions are very typical, usually having literal expressions and attribute expressions joined with binary operators, e.g.:
    a + b * c - 5
    # %# See the result?
    # Note `*` is the multiplication operator (while in everywhere else other than a programming language, it is `×`)
  }


  {## Arguments Packing & Unpacking
   # - Positional & named formal arguments to be packed and unpacked

Đ has a unique immutable data structure - ArgsPack, usually abbreviated as apk. An apk is created by a pair of parenthese quoting a list of positonal or named argument expressions.

    export edh'args'un'packing = bookmark()

    ; (1,)
    # %% # Or it'll be parsed as parenthese-quoted expression for precedence override purpose
    type( (1) )
    # %#

    # %% # Named arguments can be put anywhere in the list, but an apk value will be canonicalized to have all positional arguments separated from named arguments, with their respective order of appearance reserved:
    apk = ( name= 'Compl', 1, 2, year= 2021, )
    # %#

    # %% # Asterisks can be used to unpack apk/list/dict into apks
    l = [ 3, 5, ]
    d = { 'name': 'Yue', 'city': 'Chongqing', }
    ; ( 7, ***apk, **d, *l, year= 2030, city= 'Shanghai', *apk, )
    # %# As you can see:
    #
    #   Unpacking and direct argument specifications can be arbitrarily mixed
    #
    #   *** triple asterisks unpack both positional & named arguments
    #    ** double asterisks unpack only named arguments
    #     * single asterisks unpack only positional arguments
    #
    #   The order of appearance are always reserved
    #
    #   A repeated named argument replaces the value, but doesn't change where it sppears

  {## Operators
   # - Fully customizable infix operators with a few intrinsic prefix and postfix operators

There are a few prefix and postfix operators intrinsic to the Đ language, while all infix operators are customizable operator procedures. A set of infix operator procedures come with the default batteries bundled with the bare interpreter package, more Đ packages would possibly add their own operator implementations and/or overrides, along with other artifacts such as classes, methods, symbols etc.

     # - All unary

All prefix operators are intrinsic to the language, they can only be right-associative, but their precedences decide how nested operators parse, thus the semantics.

Especially note that a semicolon (or comma according to the context) may be usually needed immediately before a prefix operator which can also be an infix operator (namely `+`, `-`, and `|`), for disambiguation purpose.

    {## Customizable Infix Operators
     # - In spirit of Haskell / C++

All infix operators are defined as operator procedures, many of them are intrinsic (host) procedures, while others being Đ procedures. They all have a custom precedence & associativity/fixity respectively, and can be overridden by attribute shadowing at particular scopes.

Custom operators must be named with one or more valid operator characters, which is one of "=~!@#$%^&|:<>?*+-/" plus various Unicode characters in the following general categories:

  * MathSymbol
  * CurrencySymbol
  * ModifierSymbol
  * OtherSymbol
  * DashPunctuation
  * OtherPunctuation

Especially note that dot (.) and square brackets ([]) are not valid operator characters, they work with magic methods instead.

However, there are a few hard-coded exceptions, namely the following operators:

  * is
  * is not
  * and
  * or

Đ follows JavaScript/Java/C++ to use `this` keyword, instead of Python's `self`, however this is not a simple choice end here.


`that` reference solves a problem akin to the slicing problem of C++

  {## Closure
   # - A procedure always captures the full lexical context it is defined in

Đ closure is rather coarse grained.

{## Expression Values and Scope Wrapprs

  {## Scope Wrappers
   # - A scope can be wrapped as an object to do reflection in Đ

`scope` is a builtin class.

   #} {;

    export edh'scope'wrappers = bookmark()


    # %% # without argument, it creates an object wrapping the scope where it's called from
    method f() {
      method g() {
        let ( a, b, ) = ( 7, 3, )
        scope()
      }
      let ( c, d, ) = ( 2, 8, )
      return g() @=> g = nil # dispose g after one-time used
    }
    s = f()
    'inner has ' ++ s.attrs() ++ ', outer has ' ++ s.outer.attrs()
    # %#


    # %% # if an object is passed as ctor argument, it creates an object wrapping that object's scope
    class C pass
    o = C()
    s = scope(o)
    s.put( a= 3, c= 2, b= 5, )
    s.attrs()

  {## The `expr` Expression
   # - Original source preserved

A procedure is always called against some object, it also has a formal declaration of its arguments, what if we strip off these properties? The result is: we get expressions.

Expression is 1st class in Đ, you can create expression values with literal form

   #} {;
    {## The `expr` Expression #}
    export edh'expr'expr = bookmark()

    # %%
    x = expr a + b * c

    # %#

  }


  {## Expression Arguments to Procedures
   # - Arguments are passed in expr form, to interpreter procedures and 3af operator procedures

For an interpreter procedure or an infix operator procedure with 3 positional arguments, the first argument will be wrapped scope object of its caller, and rest arguments are all expression values.

   #} {;
    {## Expression Arguments to Procedures #}
    export edh'expr'args = bookmark()

    # %%
    x' = makeExpr( a + b * c )
    # %%
    s.eval( x' )
    # %#
